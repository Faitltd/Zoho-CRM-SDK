# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

- Email: security@yourcompany.example
- If you cannot email, open a GitHub issue with minimal details and request a private channel.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours** and provide a remediation plan within **7 days**.

## Supported Versions
We provide security fixes for:
- The latest minor release on `main`.
- The most recent `0.x` release line.

If you are on an older version, upgrade to the latest release before reporting.

## Responsible Disclosure
Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until a fix is released and you have received confirmation from maintainers.

## Security Updates
Security-related fixes are documented in the CHANGELOG and tagged with `security` in release notes.
