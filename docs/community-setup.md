# Community Setup

## Channels
- Discord or Slack workspace (choose one, document invite link)
- GitHub Discussions enabled (Q&A + ideas + announcements)
- Social handles (X/LinkedIn) for releases and announcements

## Governance
- Publish `MAINTAINERS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Define label taxonomy (bug, enhancement, docs, chore, question, good first issue, help wanted)
- Add issue templates (already in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)

## Feedback Loops
- Monthly community check‑in (GitHub Discussion)
- Track top user requests and prioritize by impact
- Share roadmap updates quarterly

## Metrics to Track
- New contributors per month
- Issue response time
- PR merge time
- Adoption (downloads + stars)
